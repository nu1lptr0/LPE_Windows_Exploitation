# LPE_afd.sys

Microsoft released the patch tuesday for this [CVE-2023-21768](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-21768) in january 2023.   
I have created this exploit after reading this blog post [blog](https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/patch-tuesday-exploit-wednesday-pwning-windows-ancillary-function-driver-winsock/) by chompie.  
Also the arbitrary write primitive used was found by yarden shafir.
